        <h1>Rouven Reichert</h1>
        <h2>Mechanical engineer at heart, software engineer with passion</h2>

        <p>Hello there! My name is Rouven, I have a M.Sc. in mechanical engineering where I specialized in robotics and found my passion for mobile robotics.
        <br>Since 2020, I am working as a back end developer at <a href="https://en.synaos.com/" target="_blank" title="SYNAOS GmbH: English website">SYNAOS</a> where I can combine my interest for software development with my passion for mobile robots by working on the VDA5050: the communication protocol between mobile robot fleet management systems and the robots themselves.</p>

        <p>Throughout my entire time at university, I was in touch with programming - originally starting with MATLAB for data analysis and evaluation and later first steps in C as part of a smaller project.
        <br>Working on the first projects and lectures in mobile robotics introduced me to the <a href="https://www.ros.org/" target="_blank" title="Official ROS homepage">Robot Operating System (ROS)</a> for which I installed and used my first Linux distro (Ubuntu 14.04), acquainted myself with the command line and developed C++ programs that were rather close to the hardware, including state machines and sensor data processing.
        <br>Nowadays, I professionally develop Java applications using the Spring framework 5. Some technologies I use daily are: </p>

        <ul>
            <li>Java (specifically Java 11)</li>
            <li>Spring framework 5</li>
            <li>PostgreSQL 15</li>
            <li>Apache Kafka</li>
            <li>MQTT</li>
            <li>Docker</li>
            <li>Kubernetes</li>
            <li>Linux and various command line utilities</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Lately, I've been also trying to get a grip on front end technologies to better understand the full picture of software applications since they have become a vital part of everyday life long ago.
        <br>This homepage is one of the results of this endeavour to further practice everything I pick up along the way and to document my journey. After seeing seasoned developers work highly effectively and confident on the command line (thanks to my awesome colleagues!), I also found my love for <i>vim</i> - I try to write this entire web page using <i>vim</i> to one day come close to that proficiency.
        <br>Since I'm a huge geek when it comes to tools like this and get hooked quite easily, I very recently started getting into configuring <i>vim</i> more to my personal preferences. If you like, have a look at my <a href="https://github.com/rourei/.dotfiles" target="_blank" title="Repo with my personal collection of configs">dotfiles repository</a> to check how my <code>vimrc</code> (and potentially other configs) evolve over time! :-)</p>
