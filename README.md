## Code For My Personal Website

### Disclaimer

:construction: This website should be considered as a work-in-progress and will (hopefully) be changed frequently!

### About

This repository contains the code for my homepage that deals with my professional journey as a software developer. The page is hosted via **GitHub Pages** (as the repository name already indicates)
and you can check it out [right here](rourei.github.io).

I'm currently trying to dig a little bit into front end technologies - since I'm working as a back end developer, I have little contact with the front end and design part of software development in my professional work.
Therefore, this website will be updated incrementally whenever I pick up new things that would make a meaningful addition to the existing content and functionality of the site.
I use this project as a learning platform and playground - therefore the first version includes little more than some very basic HTML without further styling or functionality.
Additionally, there is a rather high probability that I will actively try to include new things I just picked up and therefore, things might be implemented in a non-ideal way for
the sake of directly applying and practicing those concepts.

### Roadmap

Currently, there are multiple ideas of how this website could evolve over time. For the first iteration, it contains a brief, prose-style history about my educational background, interests and current job.
I could imagine this to turn into a somewhat interactive CV or portfolio to present things and personal projects I am or have been working on.
Alternatively, I would also like to get into the habit of blogging about problems and concepts I encounter during my day-to-day work and how I was able to solve them to eventually also help or inspire other developers
that started as a career jumper in the field of software engineering.
